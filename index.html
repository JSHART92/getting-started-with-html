<h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>
<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>The web is a very amazing thing.
  It is made up of billions of pages with
  so many different types of information.
  When someone goes on www.facebook.com, their computer <b>browser</b> 
  sends a <b> HTTP Request</b> to a <b> server</b>.
  The server finds the correct page and then relays it back through
  the chain onto the browser and in front of the person.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML is
  the basis for what most of the webpages are made of.  It is made up of text content
  markup, references to other documents and links to other pages. The 
  current iteration is HTML 5.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>The HTML documents are created using <b>elements</b>.
We tell the web browsers the type of elements by using HTML <b>tags</b>.<br>
</br>
Here are a list of some of the more commonly used tags.
<br></br>
<b>Anchor</b>- You can create an anchor tag to link a webpage
<br></br>
<b>Break</b>- A void tag. You can create an inline page break.
<br></br>
<b>Emphasis</b>-This tag is used to create italics.
<br></br>
<b>Image</b>- This tag is used if you want to use an image.
<br></br
</b>
<b>Paragraph</b>- Use this when you want to create an invisible box around a group of text.
</p>
<br>
<b>Computers Are Only As Smart As You Make Them</b>
<p>Computers only work given a series of very rigorous instructions.
  If they aren't followed to the letter then you won't get the results you are looking for.
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them. Inline elements have no width or height and are just there.
